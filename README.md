# AutocompleteInput

A lightweight autocomplete input, powered by React.

## Motivation

For the recipe manager application, that I am currently working on at the time of this writing, I felt the need of an autocompleting input.

If you're not aware of this term already, an **_autocompleting input_** is simply one where as we type, suggestions matching the entered query are shown to us. Besides the word _'autocomplete'_, this goes by a couple of other names as well, including _'autosuggest'_, _'word completion'_, etc.
